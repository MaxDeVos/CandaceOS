<h1>CandaceOS</h1>
**CandaceOS** is a modified form of Marlin 2.1.1 configured to allow a modern Creality RAMPS V2.2.1 to drive an original CR-10 printer. CandaceOS is planned to eventually become a template operating system to be flashed on all printers owned by Project P.

Changes/Modifications include:
* Repurposing hotend #1's output to be a controller fan output (MOSFET B, pin 9)
* Merging the configurations of CR-10 and CR-10S5
* Project P splash screen and faster boot
* Candace pixel art on status screen
